/*
The `launch.json` file in Visual Studio Code is used to configure debug settings for your project. It specifies the details of how your application should be run or debugged.

In the provided `launch.json` excerpt, there is a configuration for debugging Python files. Here's what each field means:

- `"name": "Python: Current File"`: This is the name of the configuration that will appear in the dropdown menu in the Debug view.
- `"type": "python"`: This specifies the type of debugger to use. In this case, it's the Python debugger.
- `"request": "launch"`: This tells VS Code to start a new Python process when you start debugging.
- `"program": "${file}"`: This specifies the entry point of your program. `${file}` is a variable in VS Code that refers to the currently active file.
- `"console": "integratedTerminal"`: This tells VS Code to run the program in the integrated terminal.
- `"justMyCode": true`: This tells the debugger to only step through your code, and not go into library or system code.

You can add multiple configurations to the `launch.json` file to handle different debugging scenarios.
